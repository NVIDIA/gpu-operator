    # The below delay is a workaround for an issue affecting some versions
    # of containerd starting with 1.6.9. Staring with containerd 1.6.9 we
    # started seeing the toolkit container enter a crashloop whereby it
    # would recieve a SIGTERM shortly after restarting containerd.
    #
    # Refer to the commit message where this workaround was implemented
    # for additional details:
    #   https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator/commit/963b8dc87ed54632a7345c1fcfe842f4b7449565
