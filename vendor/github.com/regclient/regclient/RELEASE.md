## Release v0.8.0

## Highlights

There are three headline changes in this release: slog support, external referrers, and deprecating legacy packages.

This release switches from logrus to slog.
Migration methods are included to minimize the impact on existing users.
Anyone parsing the logging output from regctl, regsync, and regbot will notice the format has changed.

External referrers allow referrers to be pushed and pulled from a separate repository from the subject image.
This feature requires users to provide the external repository themselves since a registry has no way to communicate this to the user.
An example use case of this feature are third parties, like security scanners, providing attestations of images they do not control.

Legacy packages have been disabled by default and will eventually be removed.
To continue using legacy packages until their removal, you may compile with `-tags legacy`.

## Breaking

- Breaking: Warning handlers switched from `logrus` to `slog` which will only impact those with a custom warning handler. ([PR 847][pr-847])

## Release v0.7.1

[PR 798][pr-798] fixes an issue where a malicious registry could return a pinned manifest different from the request.

- Validate the digest of the ref when provided. ([PR 798][pr-798])

Features:

- Add a `WithDockerCredsFile() regclient.Opt`. ([PR 784][pr-784])
- Add `regctl artifact get --config` option to only return the config. ([PR 795][pr-795])

Fixes:

- Detect `amd64` variants for `--platform local`. ([PR 782][pr-782])
- Mod tracking of changed manifests. ([PR 783][pr-783])
- Tar path separator should always be a `/`. ([PR 788][pr-788])

Other Changes:

- Remove docker build cache in GHA. ([PR 780][pr-780])

## Release v0.3.0

Deprecated:

- Multiple regclient APIs have received breaking changes.
- Configuration file handling has been removed from regclient. Configuration
  should be injected by options when creating the regclient instance.
- DNS and Schema configuration options have been removed. Schema is now handled
  using the TLS setting, and DNS has been separated into Hostname and Mirrors.

Command Changes:

- Docker Hub is now handled as `docker.io` in various commands and is configured
  as the default when no registry is provided.
- Redesign of the mirror handling allows each mirror to have different
  credentials and a path prefix option.
- `raw`, `raw-headers`, and `raw-body` formats added for viewing the original
  response from the registry server.
- `version` sub-commands added to output the tag and git commit.
- `printPretty` format added to output tags and manifest list in a more user
  friendly format.
- regbot creates a new reference instead of reusing an existing one.
- regbot reference adds a digest get/set operation.
- Documentation has been updated.
- `regctl image digest` on a manifest list only performs one GET request instead
  of two.
- Docker schema v1 is supported to handle older images.

regclient API Changes:

- User-Agent in headers now reports which regclient command and commit.
- Retryable code now maintains state across multiple requests to avoid retrying
  a down mirror for each layer of an image.
- API handling to the registry has been abstracted to hopefully allow registry
  specific API requests.
- Error handling updated to support `errors.Is()`.
- Image config moved behind the blob interface.

## Release v0.2.1

- `regctl registry` commands `login`, `logout`, and `set` previously required
  the nonintuitive DNS name "registry-1.docker.io" for Hub. They now accept
  "docker.io" and default to Hub when no registry is provided.

## Release v0.2.0

- Adding regbot command and image to support Lua scripts with the regclient api.
  The regbot scripts allow complex mirroring logic and enable registry cleanup
  policies to be automated.
- Support registry auth without service or scope in the challenge header.

## Release v0.1.0

- Adding regsync command and image to copy images between registries.
- Locking added to regclient to handle concurrent requests.
- Improved formatting / templating functionality.
- Handling images with external layers (copying Windows images).
- Fixing permissions of `/home/appuser` in the `regclient/regctl` and
  `regclient/regsync` images.
- Bug fix for passing multiple host configs to regclient.

## Release v0.0.5

- Adding wrapper for docker CLI plugin
- Using manifest HEAD requests for digests
