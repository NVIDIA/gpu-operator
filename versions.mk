# VERSION defines the project version for the bundle.
# Update this value when you upgrade the version of your project.
# To re-generate a bundle for another specific version without changing the standard setup, you can:
# - use the VERSION as arg of the bundle target (e.g make bundle VERSION=0.0.2)
# - use environment variables to overwrite this value (e.g export VERSION=0.0.2)
